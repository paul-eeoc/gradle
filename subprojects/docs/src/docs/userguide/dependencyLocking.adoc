== Dependency locking

=== Why dependency locking?

If your project uses dynamic versions anywhere, the resolved set of dependencies varies through time.
It is sometimes desirable to freeze a given configuration so that it will always resolve to the same modules and versions.

This is where _dependency locking_ comes into play.

Locking must be enabled on a per configuration basis.
Once one or more configurations have locking activated, you need to create the initial lock state.

During a build that resolves the configuration(s), you tell Gradle to persist the lock state(s).
It will then be used to validate that the resolution results did not change.
This will effectively result in a configuration where any change in dependencies resolution fails the build, prompting you to take action.

It is expected to preserve the lock state in version control, so that it is shared alongside the other build elements.

[NOTE]
====
Dependency locking makes sense only with <<sub:declaring_dependency_with_dynamic_version,_dynamic_ versions>>.
It will have no impact on <<sub:declaring_dependency_with_changing_version,_changing_ versions>>.
Because for the latter, the _GAV_ remains the same, it is the content - metadata and/or artifact - that changes.
====

=== Enabling locking on configurations

Locking of a configuration happens through the `ResolutionStrategy`:

++++
<sample id="locking-one" dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/dependencyLocking/lockingSingleConfiguration" title="Locking a specific configuration">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="locking-one"/>
</sample>
++++

Or the following, as a way to lock all configurations:

++++
<sample id="locking-all" dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/dependencyLocking/lockingAllConfigurations" title="Locking all configurations">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="locking-all"/>
</sample>
++++


[NOTE]
====
Only configurations that can be resolved will have a lock file attached to them. Applying locking on non resolvable-configurations is simply a no-op.
====

=== Lock file location and format

Lockfiles will be located in the folder `gradle/dependency-locks` inside the project or subproject directory.
Each file is named by the configuration it locks and has the `lockfile` extension.

The content of the file is a module notation per line, with a header giving some context.
Module notations are ordered alphabetically, to ease diffs.

++++
<sample id="locking-all" dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/dependencyLocking/lockingSingleConfiguration" title="Lockfile content">
    <sourcefile file="gradle/compileClasspath.lockfile"/>
</sample>
++++

=== Running a build with a lockfile present

The moment a build needs to resolve a configuration that has locking enabled and it finds a matching lockfile,
it will use it to verify that the given configuration still resolves the same versions.
The validation is as follows:

* Existing entries in the lockfile must be matched in the build
** A version mismatch or missing resolved module causes a build failure
* Resolution result must not contain extra dependencies compared to the lock file content

=== Generating and updating lockfiles

In order to generate or update a lockfile, you specify the `--write-locks` command line argument in addition to the normal tasks that would trigger configurations to be resolved.
This will cause the creation of a lockfile for each resolved configuration in that build execution.
Note that if a lockfile existed previously, it is overwritten.

=== Controlled lock file update

In order to update only specific modules of a configuration, you can use the `--update-locks` command line flag.
It takes a comma (`,`) separated list of module notations.
In this mode, the existing lock file is still used as input to resolution, filtering out the modules targeted by the update.
Note however that the resolution may cause other module versions to update, as dictated by the Gradle resolution rules.

----
❯ ./gradlew classes --update-locks org:foo,org:bar
----

Wildcards, indicated with `*`, can be used in the group or module name. They can be the only character or appear at the end of the group or module respectively.
The following wildcard notations are valid:

* `org*:foo`
* `org:*`
* `*:bar`
* `org*:bar*`

=== Deleting a lockfile

Simply remove the file matching the configurations where you no longer want locking.

=== Locking limitations

It is currently not possible to lock the `classpath` configuration used for build plugins.

=== Nebula locking plugin

This feature is inspired by the https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-dependency-lock-plugin[Nebula Gradle dependency lock plugin].
It is effectively an adaptation of the features of that plugin that leverage the recent developments around dependency management in Gradle.

There are differences though between the plugin features and what is integrated into Gradle core.

The main difference is that the scope of locking in Gradle is per configuration, and thus implicitly per project.
